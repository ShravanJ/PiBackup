PiBackup
========

Backup your Raspberry Pi (or really any Unix or Linux machine) using a shell script and crontab. 

Usage
========

First of all mount your external storage device. Then modify the script to backup your desired files/directories and desired backup location and create a new crontab using the syntax in Crontab Configuration. It's easy as pi :P

It works brilliantly!
